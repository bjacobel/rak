/**
 * This CloudFormation template supports both apps hosted at the root domain (e.g., https://rak.com)
 * and apps hosted on a subdomain (what is configured below, https://rak.bjacobel.com).
 * Note that setting the ProjectDomain and ProjectFQDomain to the same value will trigger config for the root domain
 * case, and will add extra resources (an additional A record and SAN for www.ProjectDomain).
 * You still need both values even if they are the same.
