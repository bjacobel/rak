/**
 * In production, we register a service worker to serve assets from local cache.
 *
 * This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives
 * it offline capabilities. However, it also means that developers (and users)
 * will only see deployed updates on the "N+1" visit to a page, since previously
 * cached resources are updated in the background.
